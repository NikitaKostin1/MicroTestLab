# MicroTestLab

Welcome to my portfolio project! This repository showcases my work in developing a deployable application using Go with a focus on multi-service architecture. This is a study project that demonstrates my skills and understanding of service-based applications, microservices, and related technologies.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've designed and implemented a simple, yet functional, multi-service application using Go. The project aims to highlight:

- **Service-Based Architecture:** Independent services that interact with each other.
- **Microservices Design:** Each component of the application is a separate service, allowing for scalability and modularity.
- **Golang Expertise:** Leveraging Goâ€™s concurrency model and standard libraries to build efficient and reliable services.
- **Basic UI:** A simple user interface to interact with the services and test various features.

## Features

- **Service Independence:** Each service is designed to be independent, which can be easily scaled or replaced.
- **Inter-Service Communication:** Services communicate with each other via defined APIs.
- **Basic User Interface:** Provides a straightforward way to interact with the services and observe their behavior.
